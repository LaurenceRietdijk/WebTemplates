/*
In the context of Express.js and web applications, middleware refers to a function or set of 
functions that sit in between the incoming request and the final route handler. 
It allows you to perform actions before and after a route handler executes. 
Middleware functions have access to the req (request) and res (response) objects, 
as well as the next function that is used to pass control to the next middleware or the 
final route handler.

Middleware can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Logging: Logging information about incoming requests, like the HTTP method, URL, timestamp, etc.

Authentication: Checking if the user is authenticated before granting access to certain routes.

Authorization: Verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource.

Request Preprocessing: Modifying the request or its data before it reaches the route handler, 
like parsing request bodies, modifying headers, etc.

Error Handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during the request/response lifecycle.

Caching: Storing frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce the load on servers.

Validation: Checking the validity of incoming data and rejecting invalid requests.

Rate Limiting: Limiting the number of requests from a specific client within a given time period.

To use middleware in Express.js, you use the app.use() method to add the middleware 
function to the request/response pipeline. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are added.
The next() function inside a middleware is crucial; it's used to pass control to the next middleware 
or route handler.
