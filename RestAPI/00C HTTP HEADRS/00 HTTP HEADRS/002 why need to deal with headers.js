/*

HTTP headers play a crucial role in web programming and API development. 
They provide a way to exchange metadata and additional information between the client (such as a web browser or API client) 
and the server (your application). 
*/
/*

Here are some scenarios where utilizing headers is essential in programming:

User-Agent and Device Detection:
You can use the User-Agent header to detect the type of device and browser being used to access your application. 
This helps in delivering responsive designs and tailored experiences for different devices.

Authentication and Authorization:
Headers are often used to transmit authentication tokens (such as JWT) or API keys, allowing the server to verify the 
identity of the client and grant access to protected resources.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
Headers like Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Origin are used to manage cross-origin requests. 
They ensure that requests from different domains are handled securely and prevent unauthorized access.

Caching and Content Delivery:
Headers like Cache-Control and ETag are used to control caching behavior and optimize content delivery. 
They reduce the load on the server by allowing clients to cache resources.

Custom Metadata:
Custom headers allow you to attach additional metadata to requests or responses. 
For example, you could include version information, unique request IDs, or timestamps for logging and 
debugging purposes.

API Versioning:
You can use headers to specify the version of an API being used. 
This is particularly important when you need to make changes to the API without breaking existing clients.

Rate Limiting and Throttling:
Headers like X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining help in enforcing rate limits on API 
requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

Cookies and Sessions:
HTTP cookies are set in headers and used for maintaining user sessions and tracking user interactions.

File Downloads and Attachments:
Headers like Content-Disposition allow you to control how files are handled by browsers, 
enabling secure downloads and attachments.

Security Headers:
Security-related headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy help protect 
your application from common web vulnerabilities.
